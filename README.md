# STEM Prototype

## Game Rules

The game spans across multiple levels.

In each level, the player must develop a solution using Blockly that, when given a list of inputs, will accept/reject the item according to the criteria specified by the level.

Each level is split into 4 phases, which are:

- __Prompt__: An explanation of the requirements for this level, e.g. "_Accept every item with a value of 6_".
- __Design__: Using _Blockly_, design a solution that meets the level requirements.
- __Test__: An animated sequence, involving items with randomised values being processed by the solution.
- __Results__: A display showing if the solution passed or failed.

In the testing sequence, the results of each item are predetermined before the animated sequence plays. With this, the player can opt to skip the animation and head straight to the results.
