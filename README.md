# Example Blockly Game

## Game Rules

The player must create a function, consisting of blocks, that will accept/reject a list of randomised values according to the criteria specified in the introductory prompt.

The game is split into 2 phases, which are:

- __Design__: Using _Blockly_, design a function that meets the requirements.
- __Play__: An animated sequence, with item containing randomised values being processed by the solution.

In the testing sequence, the results of each item are predetermined before the animated sequence plays. With this, the player can opt to skip the animation and head straight to the results.

After the sequence finishes, or if the player skips it, a results screen will open, showing the player how well their function handled the test items.
